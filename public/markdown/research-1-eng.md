# TinyFS - A Low Footprint Filesystem

## Introduction

TinyFS is a file system currently under development aimed at ensuring compatibility with both embedded systems and Linux. The project seeks to enable inter-device access and data exchange by porting the system onto lab-developed embedded devices.

## Key Features

- **Low Memory Usage**: Operates with less than 2KB of memory
- **Data Integrity Assurance**: Prevents filesystem corruption during power failures
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Applicable to various embedded systems
- **Linux Kernel Module Support**: Usable in standard Linux environments

## Technical Details

TinyFS is designed with the limited resources of embedded systems in mind. Key design principles include:

1. **Concise Metadata Structure**: Minimizes filesystem overhead
2. **Log-Based Writing**: Enhances data consistency and recovery capabilities
3. **Block-Based Allocation**: Prevents fragmentation and optimizes access speed
4. **Caching Optimization**: Maximizes performance even with limited memory

## Implementation Status

Currently, TinyFS has the following implementation status:

- Basic file read/write functionality implemented
- Directory structure and path navigation under development
- Filesystem recovery mechanism in development
- Optimization for ARM-based embedded systems in progress

## Application Scenarios

TinyFS is particularly suitable for the following scenarios:

- Battery-operated sensor nodes
- Industrial control systems
- IoT devices
- Research-oriented embedded projects

## Future Plans

- Addition of encryption layer
- Implementation of remote filesystem mounting
- Support for more hardware platforms
- Performance optimization and benchmark testing
